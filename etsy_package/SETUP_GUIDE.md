# n8n Automation Templates - Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up and use the n8n automation templates provided in this collection.

## What is n8n?

n8n is a free and open-source workflow automation tool that allows you to connect different apps and services to create automated workflows without writing code. It provides a visual interface for designing workflows by connecting nodes that represent different actions or services.

## Prerequisites

Before using these templates, you'll need:

1. An n8n account or self-hosted n8n instance
2. Access to the apps and services referenced in the templates you want to use
3. API keys or credentials for those services

## Getting Started

### 1. Installing n8n

You can either:
- Sign up for n8n Cloud at [n8n.io](https://n8n.io)
- Self-host n8n by following the installation guide in the [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/installation/)

### 2. Accessing the Templates

The templates in this collection are organized by category:
- AI and LLMs
- Email Automation
- Social Media
- Database and Storage
- Google Workspace
- And many more

Each template is provided as a JSON file that can be imported directly into n8n.

### 3. Importing a Template

To import a template:

1. Open your n8n instance
2. Click on the "Workflows" tab
3. Click the "New" button
4. Select "Import from File"
5. Choose the JSON file for the template you want to use
6. Click "Import"

### 4. Configuring Credentials

Most templates will require you to set up credentials for the services they use:

1. After importing a template, look for nodes with credential requirements (they'll have a key icon)
2. Click on each node that requires credentials
3. Click on "Click here to connect new account" or "Select existing account"
4. Follow the prompts to enter your API keys or authenticate with the service
5. Save your credentials

### 5. Customizing Templates

Each template can be customized to fit your specific needs:

1. Modify trigger conditions (e.g., change email filters or schedule times)
2. Adjust node parameters to match your data structure
3. Add or remove nodes to change the workflow behavior
4. Update field mappings to match your data sources

## Common Setup Steps

### For Email Automation Templates
- Configure your email service credentials (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Set up filters to determine which emails trigger the workflow
- Customize the response templates

### For Social Media Templates
- Connect your social media accounts (Twitter, Telegram, etc.)
- Configure posting schedules
- Customize content generation prompts

### For Database Templates
- Set up database connections (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Define table schemas or collection structures
- Configure query parameters

### For AI/LLM Templates
- Add your OpenAI, Anthropic, or other AI service API keys
- Customize prompts for your specific use case
- Adjust model parameters (temperature, max tokens, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Credentials not working**: Double-check your API keys and ensure they have the correct permissions
2. **Nodes failing**: Check that all required fields are filled in and that your data matches the expected format
3. **Rate limits**: Some services have rate limits that may cause workflows to fail; consider adding delays between actions

### Getting Help

- Check the [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io) for detailed information about each node
- Visit the [n8n community forum](https://community.n8n.io) to ask questions and share workflows
- Review the template documentation included in each JSON file

## Best Practices

1. **Test thoroughly**: Always test your workflows with sample data before using them with real data
2. **Use error handling**: Add error handling nodes to gracefully handle failures
3. **Monitor usage**: Keep track of API usage to avoid hitting rate limits
4. **Document workflows**: Add notes to your workflows to explain their purpose and how they work
5. **Backup regularly**: Export your workflows regularly to avoid losing them
